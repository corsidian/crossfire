    This file stores bootstrap properties needed by crossfire.
    Property names must be in the format: "prop.name.is.blah=value"
    That will be stored as:
        <prop>
            <name>
                <is>
                    <blah>value</blah>
                </is>
            </name>
        </prop>

    Most properties are stored in the crossfire database. A
    property viewer and editor is included in the admin console.

       on multi-homed servers. -->
